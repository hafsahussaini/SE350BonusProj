## SE 350 Bonus Implementation Project: Java-based Git Repository Static Code Analysis Tool
This code analyzer project was done for the SE 350 class at DePaul (Winter 2023).
The code analyzer is not [yet] functional but you can still see the general structure of the steps/implementation needed behind static code analyzing, which include but aren't limited to:
  - Retrieving a git repo and go through its source code
  - Using the PMD static analysis tool which is a tool that can detect issues like bugs, code smells, and other problems in source code
    - See PMD downloading reference from Main.java file comment
  - Using the CSV library to write the results of the code analysis to a CSV file
  - Testing and debugging source code
  - Using the JFreeChart as a visualization library to visualize defects found in the code
Please see my comments on each file to see more details.
